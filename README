The client comes in the form of a multiplatform python package. Although the
package has been tested on linux platforms only, it should run fine under
Windows.

Package can be installed along with dependencies by running:

obtained by running:

  python --version

You can check everything is fine by running unit tests:

==============================================
BASIC USAGE
==============================================

Adding images to the application is done through a ModifyClient instance:

  from ltu.engine.client import ModifyClient
  client = ModifyClient("my_application_key")
  print client.add_image("my_image_id", "/home/user/image.jpg")

Once you have at least one image in your application, you can start making
search queries with a QueryClient instance:

  from ltu.engine.client import QueryClient
  client = QueryClient("my_application_key")
  print client.search_image("/home/user/image.jpg")
