# LTU Engine - Python Client

## ABOUT THIS CLIENT
Jastec France is a company that provides image recognition as a service.
This Python module is a client that allows you to access the HTTP API to
perform image recognition tasks. For more information on image recognition,
please visit http://www.jastec.fr.


Note that this client cannot be used without a valid application key. Please
contact our support department to get your application key today
(support@jastec.fr).

## INSTALL
The client comes in the form of a multiplatform python package. Although the
package has been tested on linux platforms only, it should run fine under
Windows.

Note that python 2.6.+ or later is required.
To know if python is already installed or to check the version use the following command:
```bash
python --version
```

In first, install virtualenv  by typing the folling command in a terminal:
```bash
sudo apt-get install virtualenv

```

Then, create and activate your dev environment in the project folder.
```bash
cd ltuengine-python-client
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
```

The package can be installed along with dependencies by running√í:
```bash
python setup.py install
```

You can check everything is fine by running the unit tests:
```bash
./ltu/engine/testsunit.py
```

## BASIC USAGE
Adding images to the application is done through the add_image() function of a ModifyClient instance:
```python
my_application_key = "replace by your own key"
from ltu.engine.client import ModifyClient
modify_client = ModifyClient(my_application_key)
print(modify_client.add_image("/home/user/image.jpg", "my_image_id"))
```

Once you have at least one image in your application, you can start making
search queries by using the search_image() function of a  QueryClient instance:
```python
from ltu.engine.client import QueryClient
query_client = QueryClient(my_application_key)
print(query_client.search_image("/home/user/image.jpg"))
```

## ADVANCED USAGE

For advanced usage, please consult the docstrings for each function.

## EXEMPLE
An example is provided to quickly test the ADD and DELETE feature.
You have to execute the file cli.py by specifing these parameters:
Positional arguments:
  ACTION
  APPLICATION_KEY
  INPUT_DIR

Optional arguments:
  --help                show this help message and exit
  --host HOST, -h HOST  (default:  None)
  --nb-threads NB_THREADS, -n NB_THREADS
                        (default: 1)

Here, an example for the ADD feature. A folder containing 5 images is available in this client: ./data
```bash
python ./ltu/engine/cli.py add application_key ./data -n 4
```

If the parameter host is not specified, the script will hit the LTU OnDemand API.
Otherwise, you can specify your own server by adding the correct url after --host.
The url for the modify API is: http://x.x.x.x:7789/api/v2.0/ltumodify/json/
